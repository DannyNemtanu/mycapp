# MYC

Original code made by The Panthers

## Previewing the app

### Requirements

- PhoneGap CLI: `npm install -g phonegap`

### Clone
https://github.com/fabianogalaxy/mycapp.git

### Template



### View

You can now view the app either in a browser at`localhost:3000`, or using the [PhoneGap Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com/) on your device(s).


Of course, all the other PhoneGap CLI commands work as expected.

```
phonegap platform add ios
phonegap run ios
cordova platform add android
cordova run android --device
```
